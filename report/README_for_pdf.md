# README for PDF Report

This document provides instructions and guidelines for generating the PDF version of the project report associated with the EMT Assignment 2.

## Overview

The report summarizes the findings, methodologies, and results of the project. It includes visualizations, analyses, and discussions relevant to the objectives outlined in the project.

## Generating the PDF

To generate the PDF version of the report, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Dependencies are Installed**: Make sure all required packages are installed. You can find the list of dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open the `01_report.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook. Execute all cells to ensure that all visualizations and analyses are up to date.

3. **Export to PDF**: Once the notebook is executed, you can export it to PDF format. In Jupyter Notebook, go to `File` > `Download as` > `PDF via LaTeX`. Ensure you have LaTeX installed on your system for this step.

4. **Check the Output**: After exporting, check the generated PDF for formatting and content accuracy. Make any necessary adjustments in the notebook before re-exporting.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that all figures and plots are correctly displayed in the notebook before exporting.
- If you encounter any issues during the PDF generation, refer to the troubleshooting section in the main `README.md` file of the project.
